The provided code segment implements a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. Below is a breakdown of each part of the code:

1. **Imports**:
   - `numpy as np`: NumPy library for numerical computations.
   - `pandas as pd`: Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
   - `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: Matplotlib for plotting graphs and visualizations.

2. **Data Loading and Preparation**:
   - Reads a dataset from a CSV file named `'house_data.csv'` using Pandas.
   - Selects only the relevant columns ('bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_lot', 'price') from the dataset.
   - Prints information about the dataset using `info()`.

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - Splits the dataset into input features (`x`: 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_lot') and the target variable (`y`: 'price').

4. **Model Building**:
   - Splits the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.
   - Initializes a linear regression model using `LinearRegression` from `sklearn.linear_model`.
   - Fits the model to the training data using the `fit()` method.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Predicts house prices using the trained model on the test data.
   - Prints out the predicted prices alongside the actual prices for comparison.

6. **Visualization**:
   - Plots a scatter plot to visualize the comparison between actual prices (`y_test`) and predicted prices (`y_pred`).
   - Each point represents a house, with the x-axis denoting the index of the house in the test set and the y-axis denoting the price.
   - The accurate prices are plotted in green, and the predicted prices are plotted in red.
   - The legend indicates which color represents the accurate prices and which represents the predicted prices.
   - Labels are added for the x-axis and y-axis, and the plot is titled "Scatter Plot". Grid lines are also added for better visualization.

Overall, the code demonstrates how to train a linear regression model to predict house prices based on certain features and visualize the accuracy of the predictions using a scatter plot.
